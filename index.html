    <main>
        <p> I just started my journey in learning to become a web developer. My goal is to become a professional in this
            field. I have been self-studying programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C to build my skills.
            I am eager to gain practical experience and apply my knowledge in a real-world setting. I am a quick
            learner, detail-oriented, and have a strong passion for technology. </p>
